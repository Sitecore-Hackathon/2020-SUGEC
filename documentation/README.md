<configuration xmlns:patch="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/">

            startItem="/home"
            database="web"
            domain="extranet"
            allowDebug="true"
            cacheHtml="true"
            htmlCacheSize="50MB"
            enablePreview="true"

            disableClientData="false"/>
    </sites>
  </sitecore>

```

## Usage

First, let's make sure the website is up and running. Go to https://yourdomain/ and see if the Sitecore Hackathon home page is displayed.

![Homepage](images/image1.png?raw=true "Homepage")

You can browse other pages to make sure everything is working as expected. 

Now we can check how it the site is structured:

![Sitecore](images/image2.png?raw=true "Sitecore")

We have few pages to manage information, upcoming and past events and other generic pages. 

If you go to the list of events, you will see when a current event is happening and actual users can register to that event:

![Events](images/image3.png?raw=true "Events")

When you visit an event page where the registration is still open, you will be able to Register to that event by clicking on the "Register Now!" button.

![Register](images/image4.png?raw=true "Register")

 You will be redirected to the registration page where you can subscribe up to 3 team members. Do not forget to add a Team name.
 
![Register](images/image5.png?raw=true "Register")

The registration goes to a workflow process where a collaborator needs to review it and approve so the application can be published/registered.

![Register](images/image7.png?raw=true "Register")
   

There is also a section to manage Judges for the event:

![judges](images/image8.png?raw=true "Judges")
![judges](images/image9.png?raw=true "Judges")

When an event has been completed, we can also display the winner teams

![winners](images/image10.png?raw=true "winners")

NOTE: The following features are planned for future release:

- User and Team profiles.
- News or blog posts. 
- Newsletter subcription. 


That's everything you need to know about the complexity of this site!
